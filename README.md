Background:
We are building a web application for Justina who will be turning 50 by April 30th

There will be an admin back-end as well as the user's front end. She will be able to login to the webapp as an admin and communicate details of the events to her guests.

Anyone can visit the website to see information about available hotels, send enquiries to the organizers as well as make payment for the event's T-shirt.

She expects the website to be Live by April 9th.
